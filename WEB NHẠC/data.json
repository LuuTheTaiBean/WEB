    "lyrics": "Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> It must have been something you said<br> I just died in your arms tonight<br> I keep lookin' for somethin' I can't get<br> Broken hearts lie all around me<br> And I don't see an easy way to get out of this<br> Her diary, it sits by the bedside table<br> The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle<br> Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this<br> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> It must've been something you said<br> I just died in your arms tonight<br> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> It must've been some kind of kiss<br> I should've walked away<br> I should've walked away<br> Is there any just cause for feelin' like this?<br> On the surface, I'm a name on a list<br> I try to be discreet, but then blow it again<br> I've lost and found, it's my final mistake<br> She's loving by proxy, no give and all take<br> 'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times<br> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> It must've been something you said<br> I just died in your arms tonight<br> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> It must've been some kind of kiss<br> I should've walked away<br> I should've walked away<br> It was a long hot night<br> She made it easy, she made it feel right<br> But now it's over, the moment has gone<br> I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong<br> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> It must've been something you said<br> I just died in your arms tonight<br> I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> It must've been some kind of kiss<br> I should've walked away<br> I should've walked away<br>",
